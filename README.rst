This repository contains the Django-based web frontend for the COMIC project.  "COMIC" stands for *Consortium for Open Medical Image Computing*.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

You can fetch a copy by cloning the git repository::

    git clone git://github.com/comic/grand-challenge.org.git

You can then install the requirements into your python environment with::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Testing
-------

You can run the tests by invoking::

    python app/manage.py test

Getting the framework up and running
------------------------------------

The easiest way is to use the provided docker compose file. Simply invoke::

    docker-compose up --build

You will then be able run comic at https://localhost - note that we generate a self signed certificate as part of the build so you will need to accept the unsafe to continue warning.

Editing settings
----------------
All default configuration is set in ./comic/settings/00_default.conf
To add your own configuration, create a file ./comic/settings/01_localsettings.conf. Any settings
defined here will overwrite settings in the 00_default.conf file. 

Some settings you might want to change::

EMAIL_BACKEND:
    By default, any emails generated by the framework are not sent but printed to the console only.
    To send actual emails, set EMAIL_BACKEND

MAIN_HOST_NAME:
    If you use a hostname different from the initial "http://localhost" to call the framework,
    change the MAIN_HOST_NAME and ALLOWED_HOSTS settings


Useful URLs
-----------
Here is a short list of urls which are useful to know:

- /admin # The admin of the framework, you can login in here with your superuser account.
- /accounts # Overview of all accounts
- /accounts/signin # Signin to an account
- /accounts/signup # Register an account
- /accounts/signout # Signout the current user
